# A project developing a survey for statistics students at OSU.

This project shows an example survey developed by myself for a course in Survey Methods. I was given a sampling frame and general ideas for questions. All documents were created using Microsoft Word. The survey itself was developed using Qualtrics. All of the survey elements including survey overview, recruitment schedule, and questionaire can be found [here](https://github.com/mklapman/survey_development/blob/main/Final_report.pdf).
